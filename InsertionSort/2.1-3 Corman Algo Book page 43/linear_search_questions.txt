Previous Question:
Linear Search Problem:
Input: A sequence of n numbers A = {a1, a2, ..., an} and a value v.
Output:
- An index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL if v does not appear in A.
Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking for v.
Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

Updated Question:
Linear Search Problem:
Input: A sequence of n numbers A = {a1, a2, ..., an} and a value v.
Output:
- If v exists in A, output all indices where v occurs and count how many times it appears.
- If v does not exist in A, output 'The value does not exist.'

Write a linear search algorithm that iterates through the array A to find all occurrences of the value v. Ensure the algorithm can handle multiple occurrences and provides clear output for both successful and unsuccessful searches.
